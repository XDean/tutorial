## About React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React is one of the most popular frontend framework today.

## Why this Tutorial

[React official doc][react-doc] was written a few years ago, which is out of date now.

React team is now planning [write a new doc][react-new-doc-issue] in next major release.

> Over the next months, we're planning to rebuild our website with fresh content!
> <br/>
> Since Hooks have become increasingly popular in the React community,
> we have heard from confused learners as well as industry trainers asking why the docs are still so class component-centric.
> Additionally, while more and more educational materials for React are being created every day,
> there are still things not being taught because we have failed to explain them well.
> <br/>
> We want to make reactjs.org the best place to grok React.
> We want to be there with you from the moment you make your first component,
> to well into your career as your React knowledge deepens and advances.

This document could be a good alternative before the new doc.
It will focus on Hooks API and help you understand core React **with online examples**.

To read this document, ensure you have basic knowledge about HTML/JS/CSS.

## About Online Code Editor

Below is a simple `Hello World` example:

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/hello-world.jsx'} css={'/react/code/hello-world.css'}/>

<p/>

You can see we render a blue 'Hello World' in the right preview pane.

In the code editor, you should render your component into the node whose `id=root`.

Now, you can start your React learning journey.
