import {SrcReactEditor} from "../../editor/SrcReactEditor";

We have seen the  `Hello World` example in last chapter.
It only has few lines, but in fact, it has shown the core function about React.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/hello-world.jsx'} css={'/react/code/hello-world.css'}/>

React only do one thing: RENDER.

We call `ReactDOM.render` to render React component onto target DOM element.
The `App` variable in example above is the simplest React component.

You may find the JS code is not normal.
We write `<h1/>` directly in Javascript code.
It looks like HTML, but it's not.

It is JSX, which is our next chapter's topic.
