Context is a popular concept in the program world, which represents the state of the environment in which the program is running.
In React, we can use `React.createContext` to create a context, and use `useContext` to get the context.

Do you remember the question we left in the state promotion section,
using Context we can solve the problem of multi-level state nesting and easily access the state provided by the parent component.

## Create Context

First, call `createContext` to create context.
You need to pass a default value of the context.

```jsx
const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue)
```

## Apply Context

Now we have the Context, we need add the `Context.Provider` tag to apply the context into component tree.

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <MyContext.Provider value={...}>
    ...
  </MyContext>
)
```

## Use Context

After apply the context, child nodes can use the context by `useContext`

```jsx
const Child = () => {
  const ctx = React.useContext(MyContext);
  ...
}
```

## Example

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/context.jsx'} css={'/react/code/context.css'}/>

We define a theme context, which contains two color modes: `light` and `dark`.
Try to change the `value` in the `ThemeContext.Provider` to `themes.dark`, you will see the color change.

## Modify Context Value

Of course, we can't modify the context by changing the code manually.
We want to change the theme by click button.

We can change the context value to be a state, and add a method to toggle the theme in the context.
Then you can call the method in the context to toggle the theme in the child node.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/context2.jsx'} css={'/react/code/context.css'}/>

## Other Tips

- Same context can be defined multiple times. The child component will get the closest context.
- If the parent node does not define a context, the obtained context is the default value.
- Different contexts can be applied at same time.

Example about multi-context:

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');
const UserContext = React.createContext({name: 'Guest'});

const App = () =>(
  <ThemeContext.Provider value={'light'}>
    <UserContext.Provider value={{name: 'xdean'}}>
      <Layout/>
    </UserContext.Provider>
  </ThemeContext.Provider>
)
```
