import {SrcReactEditor} from "../../editor/SrcReactEditor";

Do you remember, in the Controlled Components chapter, I said React can also operate on DOM elements?

The way is to use `useRef` hook.

```javascript
// create ref
const ref = useRef(initialValue)
// change ref value
ref.current = ...
```

`useRef` accept an optional default value, return a ref object.
It only has one attribute `current`.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/ref.jsx'}/>

1. Create a ref object by `useRef`
2. Pass the ref object to the `input` element, and the corresponding DOM element will be set to ref when render
3. Read `ref.current` to get DOM elements

Note that, ref is not state, it will not cause re-render when change.
