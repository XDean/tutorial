import {SrcReactEditor} from "../../editor/SrcReactEditor";

export const meta = {
  id: 'jsx',
  name: 'JSX',
}

Let's take a look into `Hello World` again.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/hello-world.jsx'}/>

It seems we write "HTML" directly in Javascript, but in fact it is not HTML, neither string literal.

It is JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript.
It allows us to write HTML-like code in JavaScript.
Then it will transfer them as React element when compiled.
Such as:

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);

// will transfered to

const App = () => React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

With JSX, it is very convenient to write UI code in JavaScript.
Because all the things is in JavaScript, we can insert JavaScript in JSX tag.
We need use `{}` to wrap JavaScript content, it can be inserted into attribute/content.


<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/jsx.jsx'}/>

In another side, JSX tag itself is JavaScript value. It can be used as parameter or return value.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/jsx2.jsx'}/>
