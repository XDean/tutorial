import {SrcReactEditor} from "../../editor/SrcReactEditor";

We have learned how to use JSX syntax to define React element in previous chapter.

React element is not DOM element, it is JS object.
The creation cost is much smaller than DOM element.

The core work of React is to render React element as DOM element.

In the process, React will first make a diff between current element tree and previous one.
It will perform minimal update instead of rebuilding the entire DOM tree.

Below is a simplest example to show how to use `ReactDOM.render` to render React element.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/render.jsx'}/>

At the same time, let's recall the `Hello World` example.

We use `ReactDOM.render` to render `<App/>` element.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/hello-world.jsx'}/>

Well, you may have noticed that unlike built-in HTML (such as `h1`), `App` tag defined by ourselves.

The `App` is a simplest **React Component**. We will learn React Component in later chapter.
