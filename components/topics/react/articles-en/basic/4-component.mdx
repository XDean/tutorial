import {SrcReactEditor} from "../../editor/SrcReactEditor";

The so-called Component is actually a JS function.
It accepts one input parameter(called `props`), and return React element.

Component can be used as JSX tag. It will help us to re-use UI code.

## Define Component

The way to define components has already been seen in the time-honored `Hello World` example.

Well, you can define normal `function` instead of arrow function. Try in the editor below.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/component.jsx'}/>

## Component Properties

In the previous examples, our component did not receive any input parameters.
So let's take a look at example with input parameter.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/component2.jsx'}/>

As you cna see, in JSX tag, we can pass `props` to component by attribute.

**Note**, the component must be a pure function, that is, the property `props` is immutable.
If you want to control your component, you should use `state`, which will learn in later chapter.

## Reuse

As we said before, component make re-use very simple.

Below example shows how to re-use `Welcome` component.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/component3.jsx'}/>
