import {SrcReactEditor} from "../../editor/SrcReactEditor";

In Component chapter, we said `props` is immutable. To manage internal state we should use `useState`.

Let's see following Counter example

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/state.jsx'}/>

`useState` accepts a parameter as the state's default value, or it can be left blank to be `undefined`.
Then it returns an array containing two values

1. The state's value, `count`
2. The function to update the state, `setCount`

We can call `setCount` to update count value.
When state changed, React will re-render the component.

## Update State

You may have noticed that `setCount` can accept value (like `0`) or function (like `c => c + 1`) as parameter.

When your update the state, if you want to use the original value of the state, you should not use it directly.
The correct way is to use a function as a parameter, and the current value of the state will be used as an input parameter of the function.

```js
setCount(count + 1) // WRONG
setCount(c => c + 1) // Correct
```
