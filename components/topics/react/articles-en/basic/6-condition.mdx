import {SrcReactEditor} from "../../editor/SrcReactEditor";

export const meta = {
  id: 'condition',
  name: 'Conditional Render'
}

As we mentioned in the JSX section, JSX is actually JS code.
So of course we can use JS to control the rendering of JSX.

Let's see a simple example:

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/condition.jsx'}/>

Try to modify `login`. You will see different message shown.

Well, we can't control the login state manually.
We should define a `login` state in our component.
The knowledge about state will in State chapter.

Now we add a state to control and add two button to login/logout

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/condition2.jsx'}/>

At the same time, the example shows how to use JS ternary operators and logical operators.
