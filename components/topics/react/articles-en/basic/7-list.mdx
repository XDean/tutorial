import {SrcReactEditor} from "../../editor/SrcReactEditor";

We have learned conditional render in last chapter.
Another normal condition is to render a series component.

Let's look at the example we used in the component chapter:

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/component3.jsx'}/>

Obviously, we can't write `<Welcome/>` for every person.

So we can use list render here.

Suppose we have an array object with all people's info.
We can perform `map` on this array to calculate all JSX elements.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/list.jsx'}/>

It is worth noting that we specified the attribute `key` on `Welcome`.
If you do not specify `key`, you will receive a warning `a key should be provided for list items` in development mode.

The function of `key` is to allow React to more accurately identify which elements have changed during rendering, thereby reducing the load.
When using list render, you must specify the `key`, and the `key` between sibling nodes is unique.
