import {SrcReactEditor} from "../../editor/SrcReactEditor";

Our examples in the previous chapters are mainly simple text content without state.

Now let's consider a simple requirement

- A text box where you can enter text
- A confirmation button, when pressed, an alert will pop up to display the text content
- A clear button to clear the text when pressed

If you use simple HTML/JS to implement, it will probably look like

```jsx
<input type="text" id="text"/>
<button id="confirm">confirm</button>
<button id="clear">clear</button>

const text = document.getElementById('text')
const confirm = document.getElementById('confirm')
const clear = document.getElementById('clear')

confirm.onclick = () => alert(text.value)
clear.onclick = () => text.value = ''
```

We need to get the corresponding DOM element object, and then get the text content.

In React, of course, you can also use the same method.
The specific method will be mentioned in the later chapters of learning `useRef`,
but it's not the preferred method.

More often, we will use **Controlled Component** to manage our components.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/controlled.jsx'}/>

We set the `value` attribute of `input` to `content`, so when `content` changes,
the value of `input` will also change.

The two buttons only need to face the `content` state, and don't need to be in contact with the `input`.
The three components connect by `content` state.

Components like `input` in this example called **controlled components**, their state controlled by the parent component.
The advantage is that when you need to interact with the component state, you only need to change the state.

**This is actually React's responsive thinking. **

## Lifting State Up

In addition to the built-in HTML tags, custom components often need to be controlled too.
This pattern called **lifting state up**.

Consider that we have a temperature input component.
We can choose the unit to be Celsius or Fahrenheit.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/controlled2.jsx'}/>

Now our requirement is an automatic temperature converter,

We add two inputs to `App` component.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/controlled2-2.jsx'}/>

Unfortunately, the two text boxes not automatically converted.
Because their state managed by themselves and not controlled by outsiders.

At this time, we need to turn the component into a **controlled component**.
In other words, we **lift the state up** to the parent component.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/controlled2-3.jsx'}/>

## Summary

**Controlled Component** refers to a component whose state controlled by a parent component.
With controlled components, business logic can focus on the state instead of UI elements.

For custom components, we can actively transform them into controlled components.
So that the parent component can associate the state of the child component.
This mode called **Lifting State Up**

## Thinking

However, controlled component is not a silver bullet.

Imagine that our UI components are gradually becoming more complex.
From the top-level components to the bottom-level components,
we have experienced many layers of nesting of custom components.

So we use controlled component to converge the state to the top-level components.
But things are not going in a good direction, we need pass data in each level.

```jsx
const Avatar = () => (
  <img src={user.avatar}/>
)

const UserInfo = () => (
  <div>
    <Avatar user={user}/>
    ...
  </div>
)

const AppBar = () => (
  <div>
    <UserInfo user={user}/>
    ...
  </div>
)

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <AppBar user={user}/>
    ...
  </div>
)
```

We will learn how to deal with this situation in later chapters.
