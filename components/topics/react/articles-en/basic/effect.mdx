import {SrcReactEditor} from "../../editor/SrcReactEditor";

export const meta = {
  id: 'effect',
  name: 'useEffect'
}

In the previous sections we learned about component, and how to control state by using `useState`.

Do you remember the example `Counter`. Now we have some new requirements.

- Whenever the count changes, print the count in console

A naive idea is to add a print statement in the `onClick` method.
It will work, but it will cause us to make two changes in `count` and `clear`,
which greatly increases the cost of maintenance.

The correct way is to use `useEffect`. Let's see the example below

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/effect.jsx'}/>

Press<kbd>F12</kbd>, then click the counter, see logs in console.

As the name suggests, `useEffect` performs some side effects that are not directly related to UI rendering.
The function passed in as a parameter will be called in every rendering.

## Effect Dependencies

It works well now, but we have another requirement.

- Add a button to control the font size

It's easy! We added a new state `big`.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/effect2.jsx'}/>

Looks good! But if you take a look into console.
You will find something not expected.
It will print log when we toggle font size.

Now we need use the second parameter of `useEffect`, the dependency list.

Dependency list is an array of object. Effect will only trigger when dependencies changed.

Try to modify `useEffect` in above editor to add the second parameter.

```javascript
useEffect(() => console.log(`count: ${count}`), [count])
```

A special case is empty dependency list.
It makes the effect only triggered when the component first time rendered (also called `mount`).

Try to add following effect and see what happens.

```javascript
useEffect(() => console.log(`mount`), [])
```

## Cleanup

In real use case, effect couldn't be simple print statement.
It may be related to many external operations, such as browser API, server API, websocket and so on.
These side effects may require a cleanup operation, otherwise it will cause errors or waste of resources.

Now our counter has a new requirement.

- Upload data to server. (In our example, we replaced it with a simple print statement)

In order to reduce the load on the server, we hope it not to send data for every click,
but only when there are no more clicks within 2 seconds.
This is actually a common **debounce** feature in UI.

Therefore, we performed the `setTimeout` operation in `useEffect`, as follows:

```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(`send to server: ${count}`)
  }, 2000)
}, [count])
```

Well, it not works as expected.
Every click will trigger a request with 2 seconds delay.
What we have to do now is to remove the old side effects before the new ones.

It is very simple in `useEffect`, you only need to return the clear function.
The clear function will be executed when render becomes invalid (before next rendering or unmount).

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/effect3.jsx'}/>

Now, click the button again and again. It will only send server request when you stop.

## Summary

`useEffect` is used to execute a side effect function, it receives two parameters

1. Side effect function, this function has no parameters, it can return a cleanup function (`Destructor`)
2. Dependency list (optional)

- The side effect function will be executed every time component render.
- The cleanup function will be executed when the render becomes invalid
- If a dependency defined, the side effect will only be triggered when the dependencies change

## Thinking

After learning `useState` and `useEffect`, we can already customize many interesting functions.
Consider the counter example above, we can extract a `useDebounce` function.

Now, I want a `useEffectWithoutMount`,
the side effect not triggered when it is mounted (that is, the first rendering), how to implement it?
