import {SrcReactEditor} from "../../editor/SrcReactEditor";

export const meta = {

  name: 'Hook'
}

You may have aware that the names of `useEffect` and `useState` studied in the previous sections are all begin with `use`.
These APIs starting with `use` are called **React Hooks**, which are new features introduced in React v16.8.
Prior to this, React components mostly defined with class.

**This tutorial will not involve any knowledge about class component. Hook is React's preferred way now. **

The so-called Hooks are actually a function, they satisfy two constraints

- Can only call within React function components
- Component must call same hooks in every rendering

Counterexample：

```jsx
function fetchUser() {
  React.useEffect(() => ...) // WRONG，Hook only can be used in React Function Component
  return fetch(...)
}

const App = ({login}) => {
  if (!login) {
    return 'you are not login'
  }
  const [input, setInput] = React.useState('') // WRONG, can not use in branch, or it will be diffrent in two renderings
  return (
    ...
  )
}
```

In the previous chapters, we learned `useState` and `useEffect`, which are the most used ones.
React also defines some other hooks, we will introduce a few commonly used in the following chapters.

## Custom Hook

In addition to the Hook provided by React, we can also customize the Hook to re-use common logic.
To create a custom hook is to define a function whose name starts with `use`, and other hooks can be called inside the function.

Do you remember that in the previous section, we have completed a debounce function.
Now, we can extract a new `useDebounce` hook from it.
When we need the debounce function, we can use the custom hook instead of write the logic again.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/hook.jsx'}/>

In the previous section, we also left a question about how to prevent `useEffect` from being called in the first rendering.
We can combine `useState` and `useEffect` to implement it.

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/hook2.jsx'}/>

Now it will not print `count:0` at the first time
