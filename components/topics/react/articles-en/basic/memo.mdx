## useMemo

`useMemo`is used to create a [memorized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) value.

It accepts a calculating function and a dependency list. When dependencies changed, it will re-calculate.

```jsx
const Comp = ({a, b, c, d}) => {

  const value = computeExpensiveValue(a,b)
  // 上下两种方式会有性能差异
  const value = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

  return (
    <div>
      ...
      {value}
    </div>
  )
}
```

`useMemo` can help you improve performance by reducing expensive calculating.

You may find `useMemo` is similar with `useEffect`, but you should not mix them.
`useMemo` only cares about data about rendering.
Any operation not related to rendering should be placed in `useEffect`.

## React.memo

Another usage of `React.useMemo` is to use with `React.memo`.

`React.memo` is to wrap a component as memorized component.
If props not change, it will return the last result instead of render it again.

```jsx
const Label = React.memo(({text}) => (
  <p>
    {text}
  </p>
))
```

But in many cases, `React.memo` cannot work as expected. See the example below:

<SrcReactEditor js={'/react/code/memo.jsx'}/>

We use `React.memo` to wrap `Label` component。
Open the console, you will find `<Label data={titlt}/>` still be called when clicked.

The reason is, when `App` re-rendered, `title` object created as a new object.
While `React.memo` only do shallow diff, the memorized policy failed for `title`, so it re-render the `Label` component.

In order to create a real memorized components and improve performance, we need to wrap `title` in `React.useMemo`.
Try to modify the above code as:

```javascript
const title = React.useMemo(() => ({msg: 'React Counter', size: 20}), [])
```

## useCallback

Usually we need pass callback function to component, like `onClick`.
They will also affect the rendering, so we wrap them as memorized value.

```javascript
const handleClick = React.useMemo(() => () => ..., [])
```

But it seems not very clear with nest arrow function.
So that React provide `React.useCallback` as shortcut.

The following code is equivalent to code above.

```javascript
const handleClick = React.useCallback(() => ..., [])
```
